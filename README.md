# Calculator

## Note1: 

**This Calculator works as normal type of physical calculator:**

> 2 x 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11

It calculates from left side to right side, so it doesn't calculate multiplication and division prior to plus and minus as you do in usual calculation. 

## Note2: 

**Rounddown is not implemented yet**

Sometimes the calculation results are more than calculator's display area, sorry.

## Note3: 

**Please let me know if any issue such as when the result shows you obviously wrong answer.**
